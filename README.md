# Player Statistics Web Scraper
This is a web scraper program that retrieves pictures and saves hockey player statistics into a .CSV file. This program can be modified to get player statistics from any website that uses the HockeyTech LeagueStat API.

## Note

I first created this program when I was first learning Python and have since updated it, making it more streamlined as I have learned more
about the Python language. I first created this program to compile player data into a .CSV and download player pictures in order to create
custom player cards inside of Photoshop for my local hockey team.

## Getting Started

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install the necessary Python modules.

```bash
pip install urllib
pip install bs4
pip install selenium
```

The latest version of chromedriver is needed to run this program, and can be downloaded [HERE](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)
